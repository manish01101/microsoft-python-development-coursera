    "## Objective\n",
    "In this exercise, you will generate the following six outputs: a problem statement, a proposed solution, key features, benefits, a call to action, and a basic prototype for a school chatbot.\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "Imagine you are a student at Coursera High School, a large public high school with over 2,000 students. The school has a website that provides basic information, but it's not very user-friendly, and parents often have trouble finding what they need. The school administration is looking for ways to improve communication and engagement with parents, especially as the school is introducing several new initiatives (e.g., a new after-school program, updated academic requirements, a revised code of conduct).\n",
    "\n",
    "You've noticed that parents often have to call the school office for simple inquiries, like checking school hours, finding out about upcoming events, or clarifying school policies. The office staff is often overwhelmed with calls, and parents sometimes have to wait on hold for extended periods. You believe a chatbot could be a valuable solution to address these communication challenges and improve the overall parent experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will generate the following six outputs: a problem statement, a proposed solution, key features, benefits, a call to action, and a basic prototype for a school chatbot.\n",
